Hey Dr. Lowe,
Haskell doesn't have loops, so I ended up hardcoding pretty much everything. 
I did everything I could without loops normally. I also got to implement some interesting built-in functions, so that was fun.
I really liked the show funciton so i could print things as strings if they were an int.
Anyway, that's what is incomplete with my code.
Time to study for the final.
Have a good winter break,
Matt
