Hello Dr. Lowe
Haskell was a very challenging program to write, i found it difficult to understand it because it very hard to connect it to basic concepts of programming i.e. the 
newer programming languages. I spent hours trying to understand how the arrays worked and how it is implemented but i didn't make any progress on that but i like 
how they reading file works in haskell, but i couldnt't come up with a way to ask the user to input the name of the file. Then i tried to see how boolean worked for
this language then it threw to me edge that It just had me confused on what to do next. I would have kept more hours into this but I have lots of final project due 
and also fianls tommorrow, so i did the best i could with the limited time i had, i'm asking if you could be lenient on this project I'd appreciate it a lot. Thank 
you for understanding 

Sincerely,
David
