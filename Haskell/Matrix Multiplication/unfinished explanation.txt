Dr. Lowe,
I could not finish this program because there are no loops in this language so there is 
no way for me to loop through the matrix and have the user input their values. 
There is a method for multiplying matrices but since I cannot get the values, the method 
is pointless. Thanks for a great year, have a great break, and I will see you next 
semester for CS380
