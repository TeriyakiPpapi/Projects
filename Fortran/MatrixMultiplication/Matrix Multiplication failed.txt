I did not get the matrix multiplication done
I do not even know if it works correctly, since there are so many errors that I don't know how to fix and wouldn't run until I fixed every error
The dimensions are in the real format so that its not just integers that can be read
Logically, it should work if all the errors were fixed, but if it doesn't it might be a synatx error with the type real in the dimensions and reading in a number from user
Had a little bit of a hard time adjusting code from integer based to real based
