I have not finished yet because I am having trouble getting my iterative loop logic correct for going through all the pre-requisites and only displaying courses that can and haven't been taken. Below I have provided the Java logic for my iterative loop logic.


        boolean preqLeft = false; // Boolean to see if we need to print the finished message or not
        for (Course course : courses) {
            if (course.grade.compareTo("") == 0 || course.grade.compareTo("D") == 0 || course.grade.compareTo("F") == 0) {
                boolean canTake = true; // If a grade is too low or no grade exists, this will become false and will prevent the course from being recommended
                for (String[] group : course.preqs) {
                    canTake = true;
                    for (String name : group) {
                        if (courseHash.containsKey(name)) {
                            switch (courseHash.get(name).grade) {
                                case "A":
                                case "B":
                                case "C":
                                    break; // A-C is passing grade
                                case "D":
                                case "F":
                                default:
                                    canTake = false; // D, F, and no grade means it needs to be taken (again)
                                    break;
                            }
                        }
                        else if (name.compareTo("") != 0){
                            canTake = false;
                        }
                    }
                    if (canTake) {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                
                // Recommend applicable courses
                if (canTake) {
                    preqLeft = true;
                    System.out.printf("  %s\n", course.name);
                }
            }
        }
