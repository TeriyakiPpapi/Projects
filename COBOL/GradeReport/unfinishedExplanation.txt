Hey Dr. Lowe,
My program is essentially done. There was one element that I could not get to work, mainly due to loops in loops with if statments in between not wanting to work for me.
The Output prints all the information, but does not stack assigments of the same category like it should.
It is capable of doing everything else, assuming the file is not infinetly large. I used 10 as a test case, but it could be increased in all the loops.
Thanks for your help during your office hours!
Matt
